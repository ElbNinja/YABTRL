Yet Another BattleTech Reading List
[PDF Version](https://github.com/ElbNinja/YABTRL/blob/main/Yet%20Another%20BattleTech%20Reading%20List.pdf?raw=true)

I am missing the last 20 years of the BattleTech timeline. 
Which is why I started the project to (re-)read the most important or interesting BattleTech books and created this reading list to have any chance to navigate the uncountable amount of BattleTech stories out there.

To get started, this reading recommendation is based on the Humble Bundle: BattleTech Fiction Collection April 2024 and the recommendation of "Battletech Essential & Suggested Reading List" by u/Insaniac99 on reddit.com. 

It will be updated this repository while Iâ€™m going thru all the books. 

Also, I'm new to GitHub and this repository stuff. So I use this project to learn GitHub :)
