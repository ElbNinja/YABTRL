## YABTRL | Yet Another BattleTech Reading List
Reading books with giant death machines and war crimes is fun!

## What?
The YABTRL is a curated list to help new (and old) BattleTech Fans to navigate the uncountable number of books for the BattleTech universe.
It does this by sorting the books based on the BattleTech timeline, but does not follow the timeline blindly. 
To provide a better reading experience, the books are also arranged to hold story arcs together and to keep things interesting.
Additionally, I add commentary to the books as I read them. To provide some insights and my unsolicited opinion about it. My annotations are not spoiler free in regard to the overall BattleTech timeline, but do not spoil the story of the book.

Currently I only maintaine the list as a [PDF File](Yet%20Another%20BattleTech%20Reading%20List.pdf?raw=true).


## Why?
I am missing the last 20 years of the BattleTech timeline. 
Which is why I started the project to (re-)read the most important or interesting BattleTech books and created this reading list to have any chance to navigate the uncountable amount of BattleTech stories out there.

To get started, this reading recommendation is based on the Humble Bundle: BattleTech Fiction Collection April 2024 and the recommendation of "Battletech Essential & Suggested Reading List" by u/Insaniac99 on reddit.com. 

It will be updated this repository while Iâ€™m going thru all the books. 

Also, I'm new to GitHub and this repository stuff. So I use this project to learn GitHub :)
